{"name":"Lenshawmasonry","tagline":"","body":"Len Shaw accepted a 1/3 deposit and a 1/3 draw on the repair of a stone wall plus associated repairs on my property, a total of $3000.00. His crew did substandard work. When I complained, Mr. Shaw abandoned the half completed job. After waiting several months for Mr. Shaw to return, I sued him in the Morgan County, WV Magistrate Court (case number 06C-0000485) and was awarded a full refund, plus losses incurred because Mr. Shawâ€™s crew removed stone and top soil that belonged to me for use at another job site. Since that judgement, I have twice offered Mr. Shaw the opportunity to complete the job properly in lieu of paying the judgement. I even told him I was willing to pay him the outstanding 1/3 draw if he completed the job in it's entirety. He has never returned to the job site, though he said he would, and over the past eight years he has not paid one dime towards settling the judgement. With interest, he now owes me over $7000.00.\r\n\r\nI suggest that anyone considering hiring Mr. Shaw inquire about his reliability. The best way to do this is to choose any general contractor at random from the Berkeley Springs, WV listings in the Yellow Pages. Call that contractor and ask if they will recommend Mr. Shaw. I wish I had done that, it would have saved me a great deal of money and aggravation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions about this posting.\r\n\r\nBob Wurster\r\n304 258-3009","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
